Enterprises in industries like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare are inundated with a constant flow of documentsâ€”from financial reports and contracts to patient records and supply chain documents. Historically, processing and extracting insights from these unstructured data sources has been a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone task. However, the rise of intelligent document processing (IDP), which uses the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to automate the extraction, classification, and analysis of data from various document types is transforming the game. For manufacturers, this means streamlining processes like purchase order management, invoice processing, and supply chain documentation. Financial services firms can accelerate workflows around loan applications, account openings, and regulatory reporting. And in healthcare, IDP revolutionizes patient onboarding, claims processing, and medical record keeping.

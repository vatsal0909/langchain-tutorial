It may be mentioned here\\nthat this activity can be undertaken\\neither on small and individ', 'ual level,\\ne.g. (purchase and sale by a\\nshopkeeper) or on large scale in a\\nmore formal and organised', 'level\\n(purchase and sale by a cooperative\\nsociety or company).\\n(ii) Production or procurement of\\ngo', 'ods and services: Before goods\\nare \\noffered \\nto \\npeople \\nfor\\nconsumption, these must be either\\nprodu', 'ced or procured by business\\nenterprises. Thus, every business\\nenterprise either manufactures the\\ngoo', 'ds it deals in or acquires them\\nfrom producers, to be further sold\\nto consumers or users. Goods may', 'consist of consumable items of\\ndaily use, such as sugar, ghee,\\npen, notebook, etc., or capital\\ngoods', ', like machinery, furniture,\\netc., Services may include facilities\\noffered to consumers, business\\nfi', 'rms and organisations in the\\nform of transportation, banking,\\nelectricity, etc.\\n(iii) Sale or exchan', 'ge of goods and\\nservices: Directly or indirectly,\\nbusiness involves transfer or\\nexchange of goods an', 'd services for\\nvalue. If goods are produced not for\\nthe purpose of sale but for personal\\nconsumption', ', it cannot be called a\\nbusiness activity. Cooking food at\\nhome for the family is not business,\\nbut', 'cooking food and selling it to\\nothers in a restaurant is business.\\nThus, one essential characteristi', 'c\\nof business is that there should be\\nsale or exchange of goods or\\nservices between the seller and t', 'he\\nbuyer.\\n(iv)  Dealings in goods and services\\non a regular basis: Business\\ninvolves dealings in goo', 'ds or\\nservices on a regular basis. One\\nsingle transaction of sale or\\npurchase, therefore, does not\\nc', 'onstitute business. Thus, for\\nexample, if a person sells his/her\\ndomestic radio set even at a profit', ',\\nit will not be considered a business\\nactivity. But if he/she sells radio\\nsets regularly either thr', 'ough a\\nshop or from his/her residence, it\\nwill be regarded as a business\\nactivity.\\n(v) Profit earnin', 'g: One of the main\\npurpose of business is to earn\\nincome by way of profit.

Every business is said to be\\nan attempt on the part of busine', 'ss\\npeople to get more than what has been\\nspent or invested, or in other words, to\\nearn profit which', 'is the excess of\\nrevenue over cost. However, it is being\\nincreasingly realised nowadays that\\nbusines', 's enterprises are part of\\nthe society and need to fulfill\\nseveral objectives, including social\\nrespo', 'nsibility, to survive and prosper\\nin the long run.

Every\\nbusiness is an attempt to reap more\\nthan what has been invested, and profit\\nis', 'the excess of revenue over cost. Profit\\nmay be regarded as an essential\\nobjective of business for va', 'rious\\nreasons: (i) it is a source of income for\\nbusiness persons, (ii) it can be a source\\nof finance', 'for meeting expansion\\nrequirements of business, (iii) it\\nindicates the efficient working of\\nbusines', 's, (iv) it can be taken as the\\nsociety’s approval of the utility of\\nbusiness, and (v) it builds the', 'reputation of a business enterprise.\\nHowever, too much emphasis on\\nprofit to the exclusion of other', 'objectives\\ncan be dangerous for good business.\\n2018-19']\n",

Objectives have to\\nbe s', 'pecific in every area and sphere of\\nbusiness.

There are two\\nkinds of innovation in', 'every\\nbusiness i.e., (i) innovation in\\nproduct or services; and (ii)\\ninnovation in various skills an', 'd\\nactivities needed to supply\\nproducts and services.

For example,\\ndema', 'nd for a particular product may\\ndecline due to change in tastes and\\npreferences of consumers or due', 'to\\nincreased competition from other\\nproducers. Lower demand results in\\nlong sales and profits. In an', 'other\\nsituation, the shortage of raw materials\\nin the market may shoot up its price.\\nThe firm using', 'these raw materials will\\nhave to pay more for buying them. As a\\nresult, cost of production may incre', 'ase\\nwhich, in turn, may reduce profits.\\nBusiness enterprises constantly\\nface two types of risk : spe', 'culative and\\npure. Speculative risks involve both the\\npossibility of gain, as well as, the\\npossibili', 'ty of loss. Speculative risks\\narise due to changes in market\\nconditions, including fluctuations in\\nd', 'emand and supply, changes in prices\\nor changes in fashion and tastes of\\ncustomers. Favourable market', 'conditions are likely to result in gains,\\nwhereas, unfavourable ones may result\\nin losses. Pure ris', 'ks involve only the\\npossibility of loss or no loss.

No business can\\navoid risk, although the amount\\nof risk may vary from business t', 'o\\nbusiness. Risk can be minimised,\\nbut cannot be eliminated.\\n(iii) Degree of risk depends mainly\\nupo', 'n the nature and size of\\nbusiness: Nature of business (i.e.,\\ntype of goods and services\\nproduced and', 'sold) and size of\\nbusiness \\n(i.e., \\nvolume \\nof\\nproduction and sale) are the main\\nfactors which dete', 'rmine the\\namount of risk in a business.

Sole proprietorship\\nrefers to a form of business\\norganisation which is ow', 'ned, managed\\nand controlled by an individual who\\nis the recipient of all profits and bearer\\nof all r', 'isks. This is evident from the\\nterm itself. The word “sole” implies\\n“only”, and “proprietor” refers', 'to\\n“owner”. Hence, a sole proprietor is the\\none who is the only owner of a\\nbusiness.\\nThis form of bu', 'siness is particularly\\ncommon in areas of personalised\\nservices such as beauty parlours, hair\\nsaloon', 's and small scale activities like\\nrunning a retail shop in a locality.\\nformation as well as closure', 'of\\nbusiness.\\n(ii) Liability: Sole proprietors have\\nunlimited liability.

What is\\ncommon in all of them is that', 'one is\\npurchasing an item and the other is\\nexperiencing a service. But there is\\ndefinitely a differe', 'nce between the item\\nor good and the service performed.\\nFor a layperson, services are\\nessentially in', 'tangibles. Their purchase\\ndoes not result in the ownership of\\nanything physical. For example, you ca', 'n\\nonly seek advice from the doctor, you\\ncannot purchase him. Services are all\\nthose economic activit', 'ies that are\\nintangible and imply an interaction to\\nbe realised between the service provider\\nand the', 'consumer.\\nServices are those separately\\nidentifiable, essentially intangible\\nactivities that provid', 'es satisfaction of\\nwants, and are not necessarily linked to\\nthe sale of a product or another service', '.\\nAll of us have seen a petrol pump. Have your ever thought how a petrol pump\\nowner does his busines', 's in a village? How he gets the petrol and diesel to the\\nvillages in the interior? How he gets the m', 'oney to purchase large quantities of\\npetrol and diesel? How he communicates to petrol depots for req', 'uirement and\\nalso to customers? How he safeguards himself from various risks associated\\nwith this bu', 'siness? The answer to all the above questions lies in the\\nunderstanding of business services. The tr', 'ansportation of petrol and diesel\\nfrom oil refineries to petrol pumps is carried out by train and ta', 'nkers (transport\\nservices).  They are then stored at various depots of oil companies situated in\\nall', 'major towns across India (warehousing services). Petrol pump owners use\\npostal, mail and telephone', 'facilities to be in touch with customers, banks and\\nthe depots for the availability of their require', 'ments on regular basis\\n(communication services). As oil companies always sell the petrol and diesel', 'on advance payment, the owners have to take loans and advances from banks\\nto fund their purchases (b', 'anking services). Petrol and diesel being highly risky\\nproducts, the owners have to safeguard themse', 'lves from various risks by getting\\nthe business, the products, the life of people working there, etc', '., insure\\n(insurance services). Thus, we see that a single business of providing petrol\\nand diesel a', 't a petrol pump is actually a collective outcome of various business\\nservices.

      "['85\\nBUSINESS SERVICES\\nA good is a physical product\\ncapable of being delivered to a\\npurchaser and invo', 'lves the transfer of\\nownership from seller to customer.\\nGoods are also generally used to refer\\nto co', 'mmodities or items of all types,\\nexcept services, involved in trade or\\ncommerce.\\n4.2\\nNATURE OF SERVI', 'CES\\nThere are five basic features of services.\\nThese features also distinguish them\\nfrom goods and a', 're known as the five Is\\nof services. These are discussed as\\nbelow:\\n(i) Intangibility: Services are\\ni', 'ntangible, i.e., they cannot be touched.\\nThey are experiential in nature. One\\ncannot taste a doctor’', 's treatment, or\\ntouch entertainment. One can only\\nexperience it. An important implication\\nof this is', 'that quality of the offer can\\noften not be determined before\\nconsumption and, therefore, purchase.', 'It is, therefore, important for the service\\nproviders that they consciously work\\non creating a desir', 'ed service so that the\\ncustomer undergoes a favourable\\nexperience. For example, treatment by a\\ndocto', 'r should be a favourable experience.\\n(ii) Inconsistency: The second\\nimportant characteristic of serv', 'ices is\\ninconsistency. Since there is no\\nstandard tangible product, services\\nhave to be performed ex', 'clusively each\\ntime. Different customers have different\\ndemands and expectations. Service\\nproviders', 'need to have an opportunity\\nto alter their offer to closely meet the\\nrequirements of the customers.', 'This is\\nhappening, for example, in the case of\\nmobile services.\\n(iii) Inseparability: \\nAnother\\nimpor', 'tant characteristic of services is\\nthe simultaneous activity of production\\nand consumption being per', 'formed.\\nThis makes the production and\\nconsumption of services seem to be\\ninseparable. While we can m', 'anufacture\\na car today and sell it after, say, a\\nmonth; this is often not possible with\\nservices tha', 't have to be consumed as\\nand when they are produced. Service\\nproviders may design a substitute for\\nt', 'he person by using appropriate\\ntechnology but the interaction with the\\ncustomer remains a key featur', 'e of\\nservices.

Any fact,\\nwh', 'ich is likely to affect the mind of  a\\nprudent insurer in deciding to accept\\nthe proposal of insuran', 'ce or in fixing\\nthe rate of premium is material for this\\npurpose. Failure to make disclosure of\\nmate', 'rial facts by the insured makes the\\ncontract of insurance voidable at the\\ndiscretion of the insurer.', '(ii) Insurable Interest: The insured\\nmust have an insurable interest in the\\nsubject matter of insur', 'ance. One\\nfundamental fact of this principle is\\nthat ‘it is not the house, ship,\\nmachinery, potentia', 'l liability of life that\\nis insured, but it is the pecuniary\\ninterest of the insured in them, which', 'is insured.’ Insurable interest means\\nsome pecuniary interest in the subject\\nmatter of the insurance', 'contract.

According\\nto it, the insurer undert', 'akes to put the\\ninsured, in the event of loss, in the same\\nposition that he occupied immediately\\nbef', 'ore the happening of the event\\ninsured against. In other words the\\ninsurer undertakes to compensate', 'the\\ninsured for the loss caused to him/her\\ndue to damage or destruction of\\nproperty insured.

It is also important to', 'know the relative merits and demerits\\nof different sources so that choice of an\\nappropriate source c', 'an be made.\\n8.2\\nMEANING, NATURE AND\\nSIGNIFICANCE OF BUSINESS\\nFINANCE\\nBusiness is concerned with the', 'production and distribution of goods\\nand services for the satisfaction of needs\\nof society. For carr', 'ying out various\\nactivities, business requires money.\\nFinance, therefore, is called the\\nlife blood o', 'f any business. The\\nrequirements of funds by business to\\ncarry out its various activities is called', 'business finance.\\nA business cannot function unless\\nadequate funds are made available to\\nit. The ini', 'tial capital contributed by the\\nentrepreneur is not always sufficient to\\ntake care of all financial', 'requirements\\nof the business. A business person,\\ntherefore, has to look for different other\\nsources', 'from where the need for funds\\ncan be met. A clear assessment of the\\nfinancial needs and the identifi', 'cation\\nof various sources of finance, therefore,\\nis a significant aspect of running a\\nbusiness organ', 'isation.\\nThe need for funds arises from the\\nstage when an entrepreneur makes a\\ndecision to start a b', 'usiness. Some\\nfunds are needed immediately say for\\nMr. Anil Singh has been running a restaurant for', 'the last two years. The excellent\\nquality of food has made the restaurant popular in no time. Motiva', 'ted by the\\nsuccess of his business, Mr. Singh is now contemplating the idea of opening a\\nchain of si', 'milar restaurants at different places. However, the money available\\nwith him from his personal sourc', 'es is not sufficient to meet the expansion\\nrequirements of his business. His father told him that he', 'can enter into a\\npartnership with the owner of another restaurant, who will bring in more funds\\nbut', 'it would also require sharing of profits and control of business. He is also\\nthinking of getting a', 'bank loan. He is worried and confused, as he has no idea\\nas to how and from where he should obtain a', 'dditional funds. He discusses the\\nproblem with his friend Ramesh, who tells him about some other met', 'hods like\\nissue of shares and debentures, which are available only to a company form of\\norganisation', '. He further cautions him that each method has its own advantages\\nand limitations and his final choi', 'ce should be based on factors like the purpose\\nand period for which funds are required.

      "['188\\nBUSINESS STUDIES\\nthe purchase of plant and machinery,\\nfurniture, and other fixed assets.\\nSimilar', 'ly, some funds are required for\\nday-to-day operations, say to purchase\\nraw materials, pay salaries t', 'o\\nemployees, etc. Also when the business\\nexpands, it needs funds.\\nThe financial needs of a business', 'can\\nbe categorised as follows:\\n(a) Fixed capital requirements: In\\norder to start business, funds are', 'required to purchase fixed assets like\\nland and building, plant and\\nmachinery, and furniture and\\nfi', 'xtures. This is known as fixed\\ncapital requirements of the\\nenterprise. The funds required in\\nfixed a', 'ssets remain invested in the\\nbusiness for a long period of time.\\nDifferent business units need varyi', 'ng\\namount of fixed capital depending on\\nvarious factors such as the nature of\\nbusiness, etc. A tradi', 'ng concern for\\nexample, may require small amount\\nof fixed capital as compared to a\\nmanufacturing con', 'cern. Likewise,\\nthe need for fixed capital investment\\nwould be greater for a large\\nenterprise, as co', 'mpared to that of a\\nsmall enterprise.\\n(b) Working Capital requirements:\\nThe financial requirements o', 'f an\\nenterprise do not end with the\\nprocurement of fixed assets. No\\nmatter how small or large a busi', 'ness\\nis, it needs funds for its day-to-day\\noperations. This is known as working\\ncapital of an enterp', 'rise, which is used\\nfor holding current assets such as\\nstock of material, bills receivables and\\nfor', 'meeting current expenses like\\nsalaries, wages, taxes, and rent.\\nThe amount of working capital\\nrequir', 'ed varies from one business\\nconcern to another depending on various\\nfactors. A business unit selling', 'goods on\\ncredit, or having a slow sales turnover,\\nfor example, would require more\\nworking capital a', 's compared to a\\nconcern selling its goods and services on\\ncash basis or having a speedier turnover.', 'The requirement for fixed and\\nworking capital increases with the\\ngrowth and expansion of business. A', 't\\ntimes additional funds are required for\\nupgrading the technology employed so\\nthat the cost of prod', 'uction or operations\\ncan be reduced. Similarly, larger funds\\nmay be required for building higher\\ninv', 'entories for the festive season or to\\nmeet current debts or expand the\\nbusiness or to shift to a new', 'location. It\\nis, therefore, important to evaluate the\\ndifferent sources from where funds can\\nbe rai', 'sed.\\n8.3\\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOURCES OF\\nFUNDS\\nIn case of proprietary and partnership\\nconcerns, the fun', 'ds may be raised either\\nfrom personal sources or borrowings\\nfrom banks, friends etc. In case of\\ncomp', 'any form of organisation, the\\ndifferent sources of business finance\\nwhich are available may be categ', 'orised\\nas given in Table 8.1\\nAs shown in the table, the sources\\nof funds can be categorised using\\ndi', 'fferent basis viz., on the basis of the\\nperiod, source of generation and the\\nownership. A brief expl', 'anation of these\\nclassifications and the sources is\\nprovided as follows:\\n2018-19']\n",

      "['190\\nBUSINESS STUDIES\\n8.3.1 Period Basis\\nOn the basis of period, the different\\nsources of funds can b', 'e categorised\\ninto three parts. These are long-term\\nsources, medium-term sources and\\nshort-term sour', 'ces.\\nThe long-term sources fulfil the\\nfinancial requirements of an enterprise\\nfor a period exceeding', '5 years and\\ninclude sources such as shares and\\ndebentures, long-term borrowings and\\nloans from fina', 'ncial institutions. Such\\nfinancing is generally required for the\\nacquisition of fixed assets such as', 'equipment, plant, etc.\\nWhere the funds are required for a\\nperiod of more than one year but less\\ntha', 'n five years, medium-term sources\\nof finance are used. These sources\\ninclude borrowings from commerc', 'ial\\nbanks, public deposits, lease financing\\nand loans from financial institutions.\\nShort-term funds', 'are those which\\nare required for a period not exceeding\\none year. Trade credit, loans from\\ncommercia', 'l banks and commercial\\npapers are some of the examples of the\\nsources that provide funds for short\\nd', 'uration.\\nShort-term financing is most\\ncommon for financing of current assets\\nsuch as accounts receiv', 'able and\\ninventories. Seasonal businesses that\\nmust build inventories in anticipation\\nof selling req', 'uirements often need short-\\nterm financing for the interim period\\nbetween seasons. Wholesalers and\\nm', 'anufacturers with a major portion of\\ntheir assets tied up in inventories or\\nreceivables also require', 'large amount\\nof funds for a short period.\\n8.3.2 Ownership Basis\\nOn the basis of ownership, the sour', 'ces\\ncan be classified into ‘owner’s funds’\\nand ‘borrowed funds’. Owner’s funds\\nmeans funds that are', 'provided by the\\nowners of an enterprise, which may\\nbe a sole trader or partners or\\nshareholders of a', 'company. Apart\\nfrom capital, it also includes profits\\nreinvested in the business. The\\nowner’s capit', 'al remains invested in the\\nbusiness for a longer duration and is\\nnot required to be refunded during', 'the\\nlife period of the business. Such capital\\nforms the basis on which owners\\nacquire their right of', 'control of\\nmanagement. Issue of equity shares\\nand retained earnings are the two\\nimportant sources f', 'rom where owner’s\\nfunds can be obtained.\\n‘Borrowed funds’ on the other\\nhand, refer to the funds rais', 'ed through\\nloans or borrowings. The sources for\\nraising borrowed funds include loans\\nfrom commercial', 'banks, loans from\\nfinancial institutions, issue of\\ndebentures, public deposits and trade\\ncredit. Su', 'ch sources provide funds for\\na specified period, on certain terms\\nand conditions and have to be repa', 'id\\nafter the expiry of that period. A fixed\\nrate of interest is paid by the\\nborrowers on such funds.', 'At times it\\nputs a lot of burden on the business\\nas payment of interest is to be made\\neven when the', 'earnings are low or\\nwhen loss is incurred. Generally,\\nborrowed funds are provided on the\\nsecurity o', 'f some fixed assets.\\n2018-19']\n",
      "['191\\nSOURCES OF BUSINESS FINANCE\\n8.3.3 Source of Generation Basis\\nAnother basis of categorising the s', 'ources\\nof funds can be whether the funds are\\ngenerated from within the organisation or\\nfrom external', 'sources. Internal sources\\nof funds are those that are generated from\\nwithin the business. A busines', 's, for\\nexample, can generate funds internally by\\naccelerating collection of receivables,\\ndisposing o', 'f surplus inventories and\\nploughing back its profit. The internal\\nsources of funds can fulfill only', 'limited\\nneeds of the business.\\nExternal sources of funds include\\nthose sources that lie outside an\\no', 'rganisation, such as suppliers,\\nlenders, and investors. When large\\namount of money is required to be', 'raised, it is generally done through the\\nuse of external sources. External funds\\nmay be costly as c', 'ompared to  those\\nraised through internal sources. In\\nsome cases, business is required to\\nmortgage i', 'ts assets as security while\\nobtaining funds from external sources.\\nIssue of debentures, borrowing fr', 'om\\ncommercial banks and financial\\ninstitutions and accepting public\\ndeposits are some of the example', 's of\\nexternal sources of funds commonly\\nused by business organisations.\\n8.4\\nSOURCES OF FINANCE\\nA bus', 'iness can raise funds from\\nvarious sources. Each of the source has\\nunique characteristics, which mus', 't be\\nproperly understood so that the best\\navailable source of raising funds can\\nbe identified. There', 'is not a single best\\nsource of funds for all organisations.\\nDepending on the situation, purpose,\\nco', 'st and associated risk, a choice may\\nbe made about the source to be used.\\nFor example, if a business', 'wants to\\nraise funds for meeting fixed capital\\nrequirements, long term funds may be\\nrequired which', 'can be raised in the form\\nof owned funds or borrowed funds.\\nSimilarly, if the purpose is to meet the', 'day-to-day requirements of business,\\nthe short term sources may be tapped.\\nA brief description of v', 'arious sources,\\nalong with their advantages and\\nlimitations is given below.\\n8.4.1 Retained Earnings', 'A company generally does not distribute\\nall its earnings amongst the\\nshareholders as dividends. A po', 'rtion of\\nthe net earnings may be retained in the\\nbusiness for use in the future. This is\\nknown as re', 'tained earnings. It is a\\nsource of internal financing or self-\\nfinancing or ‘ploughing back of profi', 'ts’.\\nThe profit available for ploughing back\\nin an organisation depends on many\\nfactors like net pro', 'fits, dividend policy\\nand age of the organisation.\\nMerits\\nThe merits of retained earning as a\\nsource', 'of finance are as follows:\\n(i) Retained earnings is a permanent\\nsource of funds available to an\\norg', 'anisation;\\n(ii) It does not involve any explicit cost\\nin the form of interest, dividend or\\nfloatatio', 'n cost;\\n(iii) As the funds are generated\\ninternally, there is a greater degree\\nof operational freedo', 'm and\\nflexibility;\\n2018-19']\n",

      "['193\\nSOURCES OF BUSINESS FINANCE\\n8.4.3 Factoring\\nFactoring is a financial service under\\nwhich the ‘fa', 'ctor’ renders various\\nservices which includes:\\n(a) Discounting of bills (with or without\\nrecourse) a', 'nd collection of the client’s\\ndebts. Under this, the receivables on\\naccount of sale of goods or serv', 'ices\\nare sold to the factor at a certain\\ndiscount. The factor becomes\\nresponsible for all credit con', 'trol and\\ndebt collection from the buyer and\\nprovides protection against any bad\\ndebt losses to the f', 'irm. There are two\\nmethods of factoring — recourse and\\nnon-recourse. Under recourse\\nfactoring, the c', 'lient is not protected\\nagainst the risk of bad debts. On the\\nother hand, the factor assumes the\\nenti', 're credit risk under non-recourse\\nfactoring i.e., full amount of invoice\\nis paid to the client in th', 'e event of\\nthe debt becoming bad.\\n(b) Providing information about credit\\nworthiness of prospective c', 'lient’s etc.,\\nFactors hold large amounts of\\ninformation about the trading\\nhistories of the firms.

Therefore,\\nbusiness firms resort to different types\\nof sources for raising funds. Short-', 'term\\nborrowings offer the benefit of reduced\\ncost due to reduction of idle capital, but\\nlong – term', 'borrowings are  considered\\na necessity on many grounds. Similarly\\nequity capital has a role to play', 'in the\\nscheme for raising funds in the\\ncorporate sector.\\nAs no source of funds is devoid of\\nlimitati', 'ons, it is advisable to use a\\ncombination of sources, instead of\\nrelying only on a single source. A', 'number of factors affect the choice of\\nthis combination, making it a very\\ncomplex decision for the b', 'usiness. The\\nfactors that affect the choice of source\\nof finance are briefly discussed below:\\n(i) Co', 'st: There are two types of cost viz.,\\nthe cost of procurement of funds and\\ncost of utilising the fun', 'ds. Both\\nthese costs should be taken into\\naccount while deciding about the\\nsource of funds that will', 'be used by\\nan organisation.\\n(ii) Financial strength and stability\\nof operations: The financial\\nstre', 'ngth of a business is also a key\\ndeterminant. In the choice of source\\nof funds business should be in', 'a\\nsound financial position so as to be\\nable to repay the principal amount\\nand interest on the borro', 'wed\\namount.

      "['207\\nSOURCES OF BUSINESS FINANCE\\ncharged funds like preference\\nshares and debentures should be\\ncarefu', 'lly selected as these add to the\\nfinancial burden of the organisation.\\n(iii)\\nForm of  organisation a', 'nd\\nlegal status: The form of business\\norganisation and status influences\\nthe choice of a source for', 'raising\\nmoney. A partnership firm, for\\nexample, cannot raise money by\\nissue of equity shares as thes', 'e can\\nbe issued only by a joint stock\\ncompany.\\n(iv) Purpose and time period:\\nBusiness should plan ac', 'cording to\\nthe time period for which the funds\\nare required. A short-term need for\\nexample can be me', 't through\\nborrowing funds at low rate of\\ninterest through trade credit,\\ncommercial paper, etc. For l', 'ong\\nterm finance, sources such as issue\\nof shares and debentures are more\\nappropriate. Similarly, th', 'e purpose\\nfor which funds are required need\\nto be considered so that the source\\nis matched with the', 'use. For\\nexample, a long-term business\\nexpansion plan should not be\\nfinanced by a bank overdraft whi', 'ch\\nwill be required to be repaid in the\\nshort term.\\n(v) Risk profile: Business should\\nevaluate each', 'of the source of\\nfinance in terms of the risk involved.\\nFor example, there is a least risk in\\nequity', 'as the share capital has to\\nbe repaid only at the time of winding\\nup and dividends need not be paid', 'if no profits are available. A loan on\\nthe other hand, has a repayment\\nschedule for both the princi', 'pal and\\nthe interest. The interest is required\\nto be paid irrespective of the firm\\nearning a profit', 'or incurring a loss.\\n(vi) Control: A particular source of\\nfund may affect the control and\\npower of t', 'he owners on the\\nmanagement of a firm. Issue of\\nequity shares may mean dilution of\\nthe control. For', 'example, as equity\\nshare holders enjoy voting rights,\\nfinancial institutions may take\\ncontrol of the', 'assets or impose\\nconditions as part of the loan\\nagreement. Thus, business firm\\nshould choose a sour', 'ce keeping in\\nmind the extent to which they are\\nwilling to share their control over\\nbusiness.\\n(vii)', 'Effect on credit worthiness: The\\ndependence of business on certain\\nsources may affect its credit\\nwor', 'thiness in the market.

In general the\\nsmall businesses are faced with the\\nfollow', 'ing problems:\\n(i) Finance: One of the severe\\nproblems faced by SSIs is that of\\nnon-availability of a', 'dequate finance to\\ncarry out its operations.\\nGenerally a small business begins\\nwith a small capital', 'base. Many of the\\nunits in the small sector lack the credit\\nworthiness required to raise as capital', 'from the capital markets. As a result,\\nthey heavily depend on local financial\\nresources and are freq', 'uently the\\nvictims of exploitation by the money\\nlenders. These units frequently suffer\\nfrom lack of', 'adequate working capital,\\neither due to delayed payment of dues\\nto them or locking up of their capit', 'al in\\nunsold stocks. Banks also do not lend\\nmoney without adequate collateral\\nsecurity or guarantees', 'and margin\\nmoney, which many of them are not in\\na position to provide.\\n(ii) Raw materials: Another', 'major\\nproblem of small business is the\\nprocurement of raw materials. If the\\nrequired materials are n', 'ot available,\\nthey have to compromise on the quality\\nor have to pay a high price to get good\\nquality', 'materials. Their bargaining\\npower is relatively low due to the small\\nquantity of purchases made by', 'them.\\nAlso, they cannot afford to take the risk\\nof buying in bulk as they have no\\nfacilities to stor', 'e the materials. Because\\nof general scarcity of metals, chemicals\\nand extractive raw materials in th', 'e\\neconomy, the small scale sector suffers\\nthe most.

Many of the small\\nbusiness entrepreneurs possess sound\\ntechnical knowledge but are less', 'successful in marketing the output.\\nMoreover, they may not find enough\\ntime to take care of all fun', 'ctional\\nactivities. At the same time they are not\\nin a position to afford professional\\nmanagers.\\n(iv', ') Labour: Small business firms\\ncannot afford to pay higher salaries to\\nthe employees, which affects', 'employee\\nwillingness to work hard and produce\\nmore.

It may be mentioned here', 'that this activity can be undertaken\\neither on small and individual level,', 'e.g. (purchase and sale by a\\nshopkeeper) or on large scale in a\\nmore formal and organised level', '(purchase and sale by a cooperative\\nsociety or company).\\n(ii) Production or procurement of', 'goods and services: Before goods\\nare \\noffered \\nto \\npeople \\nfor\\nconsumption, these must be either', 'produced or procured by business\\nenterprises. Thus, every business', 'enterprise either manufactures the\\ngoods it deals in or acquires them', 'from producers, to be further sold\\nto consumers or users. Goods may\\nconsist of consumable items of', 'daily use, such as sugar, ghee,\\npen, notebook, etc., or capital\\ngoods, like machinery, furniture,', 'etc., Services may include facilities\\noffered to consumers, business\\nfirms and organisations in the', 'form of transportation, banking,\\nelectricity, etc.\\n(iii) Sale or exchange of goods and', 'services: Directly or indirectly,\\nbusiness involves transfer or\\nexchange of goods and services for', 'value. If goods are produced not for\\nthe purpose of sale but for personal', 'consumption, it cannot be called a\\nbusiness activity. Cooking food at', 'home for the family is not business,\\nbut cooking food and selling it to', 'others in a restaurant is business.\\nThus, one essential characteristic', 'of business is that there should be\\nsale or exchange of goods or', 'services between the seller and the\\nbuyer.\\n(iv)  Dealings in goods and services', 'on a regular basis: Business\\ninvolves dealings in goods or\\nservices on a regular basis. One', 'single transaction of sale or\\npurchase, therefore, does not\\nconstitute business. Thus, for', 'example, if a person sells his/her\\ndomestic radio set even at a profit,', 'it will not be considered a business\\nactivity.

These are discussed as\\nbelow:', '(i) Intangibility: Services are\\nintangible, i.e., they cannot be touched.', 'They are experiential in nature. One\\ncannot taste a doctor’s treatment, or', 'touch entertainment. One can only\\nexperience it. An important implication', 'of this is that quality of the offer can\\noften not be determined before', 'consumption and, therefore, purchase.\\nIt is, therefore, important for the service', 'providers that they consciously work\\non creating a desired service so that the', 'customer undergoes a favourable\\nexperience. For example, treatment by a', 'doctor should be a favourable experience.\\n(ii) Inconsistency: The second', 'important characteristic of services is\\ninconsistency. Since there is no', 'standard tangible product, services\\nhave to be performed exclusively each', 'time. Different customers have different\\ndemands and expectations. Service', 'providers need to have an opportunity\\nto alter their offer to closely meet the', 'requirements of the customers. This is\\nhappening, for example, in the case of\\nmobile services.', '(iii) Inseparability: \\nAnother\\nimportant characteristic of services is', 'the simultaneous activity of production\\nand consumption being performed.', 'This makes the production and\\nconsumption of services seem to be', 'inseparable. While we can manufacture\\na car today and sell it after, say, a', 'month; this is often not possible with\\nservices that have to be consumed as', 'and when they are produced.

But,\\nat the same time, the presence of the', 'customer, is required and his/her\\ninteraction with the process has to be\\nmanaged.', '(iv) Inventory (Less): Services have\\nlittle or no tangible components and,', 'therefore, cannot be stored for a future\\nuse. That is, services are perishable', 'and providers can, at best, store some\\nassociated goods but not the service', 'itself. This means that the demand and\\nsupply needs to be managed as the', 'service has to be performed as and\\nwhen the customer asks for it.

This is known as fixed', 'capital requirements of the\\nenterprise. The funds required in\\nfixed assets remain invested in the', 'business for a long period of time.\\nDifferent business units need varying', 'amount of fixed capital depending on\\nvarious factors such as the nature of', 'business, etc. A trading concern for\\nexample, may require small amount', 'of fixed capital as compared to a\\nmanufacturing concern. Likewise,', 'the need for fixed capital investment\\nwould be greater for a large', 'enterprise, as compared to that of a\\nsmall enterprise.\\n(b) Working Capital requirements:', 'The financial requirements of an\\nenterprise do not end with the\\nprocurement of fixed assets. No', 'matter how small or large a business\\nis, it needs funds for its day-to-day', 'operations. This is known as working\\ncapital of an enterprise, which is used', 'for holding current assets such as\\nstock of material, bills receivables and', 'for meeting current expenses like\\nsalaries, wages, taxes, and rent.\\nThe amount of working capital', 'required varies from one business\\nconcern to another depending on various', 'factors. A business unit selling goods on\\ncredit, or having a slow sales turnover,', 'for example, would require more\\nworking capital as compared to a', 'concern selling its goods and services on\\ncash basis or having a speedier turnover.', 'The requirement for fixed and\\nworking capital increases with the', 'growth and expansion of business. At\\ntimes additional funds are required for', 'upgrading the technology employed so\\nthat the cost of production or operations', 'can be reduced.

      "['190\\nBUSINESS STUDIES\\n8.3.1 Period Basis\\nOn the basis of period, the different', 'sources of funds can be categorised\\ninto three parts. These are long-term', 'sources, medium-term sources and\\nshort-term sources.\\nThe long-term sources fulfil the', 'financial requirements of an enterprise\\nfor a period exceeding 5 years and', 'include sources such as shares and\\ndebentures, long-term borrowings and', 'loans from financial institutions. Such\\nfinancing is generally required for the', 'acquisition of fixed assets such as\\nequipment, plant, etc.\\nWhere the funds are required for a', 'period of more than one year but less\\nthan five years, medium-term sources', 'of finance are used. These sources\\ninclude borrowings from commercial', 'banks, public deposits, lease financing\\nand loans from financial institutions.', 'Short-term funds are those which\\nare required for a period not exceeding', 'one year. Trade credit, loans from\\ncommercial banks and commercial', 'papers are some of the examples of the\\nsources that provide funds for short\\nduration.', 'Short-term financing is most\\ncommon for financing of current assets\\nsuch as accounts receivable and', 'inventories. Seasonal businesses that\\nmust build inventories in anticipation', 'of selling requirements often need short-\\nterm financing for the interim period', 'between seasons. Wholesalers and\\nmanufacturers with a major portion of', 'their assets tied up in inventories or\\nreceivables also require large amount', 'of funds for a short period.\\n8.3.2 Ownership Basis\\nOn the basis of ownership, the sources', 'can be classified into ‘owner’s funds’\\nand ‘borrowed funds’. Owner’s funds', 'means funds that are provided by the\\nowners of an enterprise, which may', 'be a sole trader or partners or\\nshareholders of a company. Apart', 'from capital, it also includes profits\\nreinvested in the business. The', 'owner’s capital remains invested in the\\nbusiness for a longer duration and is', 'not required to be refunded during the\\nlife period of the business. Such capital', 'forms the basis on which owners\\nacquire their right of control of', 'management. Issue of equity shares\\nand retained earnings are the two', 'important sources from where owner’s\\nfunds can be obtained.\\n‘Borrowed funds’ on the other', 'hand, refer to the funds raised through\\nloans or borrowings. The sources for', 'raising borrowed funds include loans\\nfrom commercial banks, loans from', 'financial institutions, issue of\\ndebentures, public deposits and trade', 'credit. Such sources provide funds for\\na specified period, on certain terms', 'and conditions and have to be repaid\\nafter the expiry of that period. A fixed', 'rate of interest is paid by the\\nborrowers on such funds. At times it', 'puts a lot of burden on the business\\nas payment of interest is to be made', 'even when the earnings are low or\\nwhen loss is incurred. Generally,', 'borrowed funds are provided on the\\nsecurity of some fixed assets.\\n2018-19']\n",
      "['191\\nSOURCES OF BUSINESS FINANCE\\n8.3.3 Source of Generation Basis', 'Another basis of categorising the sources\\nof funds can be whether the funds are', 'generated from within the organisation or\\nfrom external sources. Internal sources', 'of funds are those that are generated from\\nwithin the business. A business, for', 'example, can generate funds internally by\\naccelerating collection of receivables,', 'disposing of surplus inventories and\\nploughing back its profit. The internal', 'sources of funds can fulfill only limited\\nneeds of the business.\\nExternal sources of funds include', 'those sources that lie outside an\\norganisation, such as suppliers,', 'lenders, and investors. When large\\namount of money is required to be', 'raised, it is generally done through the\\nuse of external sources. External funds', 'may be costly as compared to  those\\nraised through internal sources. In', 'some cases, business is required to\\nmortgage its assets as security while', 'obtaining funds from external sources.\\nIssue of debentures, borrowing from', 'commercial banks and financial\\ninstitutions and accepting public', 'deposits are some of the examples of\\nexternal sources of funds commonly', 'used by business organisations.\\n8.4\\nSOURCES OF FINANCE\\nA business can raise funds from', 'various sources. Each of the source has\\nunique characteristics, which must be', 'properly understood so that the best\\navailable source of raising funds can', 'be identified. There is not a single best\\nsource of funds for all organisations.', 'Depending on the situation, purpose,\\ncost and associated risk, a choice may', 'be made about the source to be used.\\nFor example, if a business wants to', 'raise funds for meeting fixed capital\\nrequirements, long term funds may be', 'required which can be raised in the form\\nof owned funds or borrowed funds.', 'Similarly, if the purpose is to meet the\\nday-to-day requirements of business,', 'the short term sources may be tapped.\\nA brief description of various sources,', 'along with their advantages and\\nlimitations is given below.\\n8.4.1 Retained Earnings', 'A company generally does not distribute\\nall its earnings amongst the', 'shareholders as dividends. A portion of\\nthe net earnings may be retained in the', 'business for use in the future. This is\\nknown as retained earnings. It is a', 'source of internal financing or self-\\nfinancing or ‘ploughing back of profits’.', 'The profit available for ploughing back\\nin an organisation depends on many', 'factors like net profits, dividend policy\\nand age of the organisation.\\nMerits', 'The merits of retained earning as a\\nsource of finance are as follows:', '(i) Retained earnings is a permanent\\nsource of funds available to an\\norganisation;', '(ii) It does not involve any explicit cost\\nin the form of interest, dividend or\\nfloatation cost;', '(iii) As the funds are generated\\ninternally, there is a greater degree\\nof operational freedom and', 'flexibility;\\n2018-19']\n",

Similarly\\nequity capital has a role to play in the', 'scheme for raising funds in the\\ncorporate sector.\\nAs no source of funds is devoid of', 'limitations, it is advisable to use a\\ncombination of sources, instead of', 'relying only on a single source. A\\nnumber of factors affect the choice of', 'this combination, making it a very\\ncomplex decision for the business. The', 'factors that affect the choice of source\\nof finance are briefly discussed below:', '(i) Cost: There are two types of cost viz.,\\nthe cost of procurement of funds and', 'cost of utilising the funds. Both\\nthese costs should be taken into\\naccount while deciding about the', 'source of funds that will be used by\\nan organisation.\\n(ii) Financial strength and stability', 'of operations: The financial\\nstrength of a business is also a key', 'determinant.

A partnership firm, for\\nexample, cannot raise money by', 'issue of equity shares as these can\\nbe issued only by a joint stock\\ncompany.', '(iv) Purpose and time period:\\nBusiness should plan according to\\nthe time period for which the funds', 'are required. A short-term need for\\nexample can be met through\\nborrowing funds at low rate of', 'interest through trade credit,\\ncommercial paper, etc. For long\\nterm finance, sources such as issue', 'of shares and debentures are more\\nappropriate. Similarly, the purpose', 'for which funds are required need\\nto be considered so that the source\\nis matched with the use. For', 'example, a long-term business\\nexpansion plan should not be\\nfinanced by a bank overdraft which', 'will be required to be repaid in the\\nshort term.\\n(v) Risk profile: Business should', 'evaluate each of the source of\\nfinance in terms of the risk involved.', 'For example, there is a least risk in\\nequity as the share capital has to', 'be repaid only at the time of winding\\nup and dividends need not be paid', 'if no profits are available. A loan on\\nthe other hand, has a repayment', 'schedule for both the principal and\\nthe interest. The interest is required', 'to be paid irrespective of the firm\\nearning a profit or incurring a loss.', '(vi) Control: A particular source of\\nfund may affect the control and\\npower of the owners on the', 'management of a firm. Issue of\\nequity shares may mean dilution of', 'the control. For example, as equity\\nshare holders enjoy voting rights,', 'financial institutions may take\\ncontrol of the assets or impose\\nconditions as part of the loan', 'agreement.

In general the\\nsmall businesses are faced with the', 'following problems:\\n(i) Finance: One of the severe\\nproblems faced by SSIs is that of', 'non-availability of adequate finance to\\ncarry out its operations.\\nGenerally a small business begins', 'with a small capital base. Many of the\\nunits in the small sector lack the credit', 'worthiness required to raise as capital\\nfrom the capital markets. As a result,', 'they heavily depend on local financial\\nresources and are frequently the', 'victims of exploitation by the money\\nlenders.

Banks also do not lend', 'money without adequate collateral\\nsecurity or guarantees and margin', 'money, which many of them are not in\\na position to provide.\\n(ii) Raw materials: Another major', 'problem of small business is the\\nprocurement of raw materials. If the', 'required materials are not available,\\nthey have to compromise on the quality', 'or have to pay a high price to get good\\nquality materials. Their bargaining', 'power is relatively low due to the small\\nquantity of purchases made by them.', 'Also, they cannot afford to take the risk\\nof buying in bulk as they have no', 'facilities to store the materials.

Many of the small\\nbusiness entrepreneurs possess sound', 'technical knowledge but are less\\nsuccessful in marketing the output.', 'Moreover, they may not find enough\\ntime to take care of all functional', 'activities. At the same time they are not\\nin a position to afford professional\\nmanagers.', '(iv) Labour: Small business firms\\ncannot afford to pay higher salaries to', 'the employees, which affects employee\\nwillingness to work hard and produce', 'more.
